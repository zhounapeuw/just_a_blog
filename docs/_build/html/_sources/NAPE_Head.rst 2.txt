.. NAPE2p_Benchmark Documentation documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. At the beginning of a line, ".." indicate the start of .rst syntax. For comments, we don't anything special after that.

.. Title is above = signs and length of = should be longer than the title. '=' is heading size 3, and we can use other special characters for different heading sizes, which can be referred in the cheat sheet.

.. Index of pages where names refer to relevant file names (or path if it is not in the same folder). Change maxdepth to increase number of sub headings (should be one more than actual number of headings)

.. toctree is Sphinx's custom directive to link different files together, as .rst doesn't have any feature like that

.. :caption: sets the title of our subheadings

.. toctree::
